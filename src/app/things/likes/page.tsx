        Your dream of building your own hospital and help poor peoples its some
        of the loveliest things I ever heard and its the only reason I like you
        being honest <br /> <br /> If you are depressed or stressed relating to
        me, then now you could be stress-free I am all yours, I have literally
        shown you my entire personality, if you cant even believe that I dont
        know how to make you believe more than that, its upto you, you are in my
        heat forever, now be completely relaxed and complete your dream <br />I
        dont take mom promise only because I dont trust you entirely <br /> but
        if you need any proof then here, (half-promise), mom-promise [only if
        you remain loyal] I wont even look at any other gs except my family
        members now on and you are on my mind 24x7, I have even seen people taking fake mom-promises, but I complete all of my promises as you already know<br />
        alright now? now you need to complete your dream without any doubts in
        me, I love you and only you <br />
        <br />
        how can I make you believe I dont even like actresses, but only you, and
        I am not saying this to impress you or something like that chappris do,
        they make lifetime promises, do dirty things and then get found with
        other person the next day, I dont want that kind of reputation and
        neither I want you with that kind of mindset or scars in your character{' '}
