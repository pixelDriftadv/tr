        - I dont want you to be with any other guy, <br /> - build a better
        mindset, <br /> yeah I would be direct <br /> <br />I dont even like
        talking to any other g thinking about you in my mind, its in my traits
        but you lied about your dads rules, I have always hated liars, so I need
        you to be the same and have same expectations, its not like I cant make
        g friends but rather I dont want to (because I have you, and if you
        think I talked to Aishwaya when you werent there then its half, they had
        called me for seeing whats in my handbag that day), maybe because I was
        told gs are to be respected and protected and taken care of <br />{' '}
        <br />
        Text-based are weak, so you want to be an ordinary person just because
        you actually give value to other peoples thoughts? When you told you
        want to build your own hospital I thought you are extra-ordinary but you
        are also ordinary like everyone else, just think about it, do every
        people (besides me), completes their every promises, I have seen none
        and yeah until the advise is coming from a valuable person, I dont
        actually listen to it

      <h1 className=" text-white font-extrabold text-5xl">Limitations</h1>
      <h1 className=" text-white font-semibold text-xl">
        but there are some kind of restrictions as well, but only for your own
        safety, no outisde after 20:00, I will always have to walk somewhat
        behind you (although holding your hand), so no other person sees you in
        bad places and more <br/>
        Also, I dont need you for a day, a month, a year or a decade, but my entire lifetime <br/>
        And after encountering things like se*ual abuse myself, I just want to say I would never want any of that kind of pleasure from you, if I had any kind of impurity in my mind then I would have considered ignoring this statement or just not talking about it but I can say it without even hesitating a bit (if you want any sort of proof then <u> I can say with 100% confidence I could spend my whole life with my ultimate partner without even touching her</u>), neither I would ever accept you as my friend with benefits for only dirty and disgusting things, I just want you as my lifetime partner <br/>
        My mom taught me to judge people by thier soul and not appearance and as I have said since we ever met, I always loved your soul and never ever how you look, according to me everybody has to get old one day so looks dont matter, but for this generation it does because of thier dirty and wild thoughts, I sometimes wish God that even if you didnt looked as a Goddess, I would have shown you how much I really love you and all the scavengers of your beauty would have not been there at all  
        <br/>
        <u>So my ultimate partner would be someone who understands my and only my soul and makes me stress-free for my entire life and thats just it, it would become my own pleasure to make that person or more accurately that soul happy all the time</u>

      <h1 className=" text-white font-extrabold text-5xl">In return</h1>
      <h1 className=" text-white font-semibold text-xl">
        I will treat you like my mom says for my entire lifetime close to a
        goddess, for example, your happiness brings prosperous to us (so my first priority as well as my pleasure is your happiness), your feet
        is my entire world no other gs are to be accepted in that world and more{' '}
