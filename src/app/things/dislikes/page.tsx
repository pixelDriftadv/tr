        - Transparency, <br /> - mindset, <br /> - behaviour <br /> <br />I can
        show you all of my accounts and messages, give you all of my credentials
        if you ever doubted me without even a second delay, but I also expect
        the same from you and not {'"I don\'t trust boys"'} kind of excuses or
        denials, you wanted me to delete my instagram account? well, anything for my love
        <br />
        <br />
        You could build better mindset, you sometimes talk rubbish being honest,
        I respect my every promise what do you even mean by text based are weak?{' '}
        <br /> Also, judging that you abused my sister, I had never thought you
        even know how to abuse, I thought your mind to be pure
        <br />
        <br /> If I only love you and dont want the relation to be weak, it can
        never then <br />
        If I have scars in my character, I like somebody else than you then itd
        be revealed someday and the relation ends but the instincts sometimes
        works as well and doubts arise, if you ever get that kind of feeling
        from me, you could have 100% control over me, I can say with 200%
        confidence I would never but I expect the same from you, I would never
        keep anything private, secret or hidden <br /> <br />
        Your lies, insults are of another level.
